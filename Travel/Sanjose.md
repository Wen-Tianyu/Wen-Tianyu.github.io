## Reminder
📍 [**Shang Cafe San Jose (香小馆)**] 6154 Bollinger Rd, San Jose, CA 95129\

Also a wonderful Chinese restaurant with signatures of Yunnan cuisine. Before visiting there, I would never imagine how tasty mushrooms can be cooked.

📍 [**Chicha San Chen (吃茶三千)**] 20688 Stevens Creek Blvd, Cupertino, CA 95014\
The most popular boba shop in Bay Area and if you want to have a taste, remember to order ahead online to avoid a huge crowd in store. Fruit tea there is the best!
