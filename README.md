## Bio
I am a former Graph Learning researcher from DS[<span style="color:#a60f0f">@PKU</span>](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) and now a career seeker at ECE[<span style="color:#ff6200">@UIUC</span>](https://ece.illinois.edu/). I would like to utilize my experience of academic research into industry scenarios.

I am expert in Python and C++ programming with machine learning technics including PyTorch and PyG. I also enjoys learning mathematics behind AI algorithms and intends to expand my horizens towards different application fields including Computer Vision and Data Mining.

## Interest

I was born in Xinxiang, Henan, China and spent the first 18 years of my life there. My all-time beloved is [red panda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda), adorable angels on the planet and becoming even more popular after the movie *[Turning Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Red)* on.

Music is part of my life and [Lala Hsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lala_Hsu) is my favourite singer. I also enjoys American Pop and recently I became a vinyl collector.
Also, I am a forever badminton rookie and a broken writer.
