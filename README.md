## 🎨 Interest

I was born in Xinxiang, Henan, China and spent the first 18 years of my life there. My all-time beloved is [red panda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda), adorable angels on the planet and becoming even more popular after the movie *[Turning Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Red)* on.

Music is part of my life and [Lala Hsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lala_Hsu) is my favourite singer. I also enjoys American Pop and recently I became a vinyl collector.
Also, I am a forever badminton rookie and a broken writer.
